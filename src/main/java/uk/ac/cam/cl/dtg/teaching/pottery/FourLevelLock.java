/**
 * Lock class for protecting git repos with working directories.
 *
 * <p>Four levels of lock are provided:
 *
 * <p>1) FullExclusion - this is for when you need to delete the git database or the whole
 * directoru.
 *
 * <p>2) GitDbOperation - this is when you are operating only on the git database (not the files in
 * the working directory).
 *
 * <p>3) FileReading - for reading files from the working directory
 *
 * <p>4) FileWriting - for writing files in the working directory
 *
 * <p>This table shows who is allowed to run. If you hold the lock in the column then rows with an X
 * are permitted to run as well.
 *
 * <p>| FullExclusion | GitDbOperation | FileReading | FileWriting
 * ----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------- FullExclusion | |
 * | | GitDbOperation | | X | X | X FileReading | | X | X | FileWriting | | X | |
